/*
The main idea in these algorithms will be to first implement the functions that
provide the actual solution, and then implement functions that will visualize
these solutions by altering the classname of each explored node in order to
colorize which nodes are in progress, which ones are visited, and ultimately 
highlight the final path. The animation will be taken care of in
PathfindingVisualizer, while we provide the actual backend of the algorithms here.
