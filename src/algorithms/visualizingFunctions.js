/* NOTE 1
    The way we animate the pathfinder-algorithm, is to have
    an array of visited nodes, and create a copy of the existing
    grid every time we iterate through a visited node.
    This is as an external function that sets a timeout every time
    a node is iterated, instead of being taken care of inside of
    the render function. We iterate through all visited nodes, and
    for each node, we create a copy grid, and a copy node.
    We replace the existing node in the copy grid, with the
    copy node that has updated its isVisited-state.
    We pass in the copy grid as the new state of the React-component,
    and set a timeout. Therefore, the state will update itself with
    an interval of the timeout-value, which will be perceived as
    individual boxes changing their layouts because every state-update
    changes a single node. 
*/
/* NOTE 2
    The aforementioned approach worked, however it was extremely slow and tedious.
    The new approach changes the classnames of the DOM-elements directly, instead of
    updating state (triggering re-render several times a second, which takes too much time).
    This is bad practice, but for this purpose it works just fine, and is a lot quicker.
    It also works easily because a node can only be in one of five states:
    start, finish, visited, wall, or shortest-path. Therefore we can update them without issues.
*/
/* NOTE 3
    Instead of referring directly to the DOM-element, one could instead use ReactRef.
    However, that would imply that all of these functions would need to be implemented
    in PathfinderVisualizer.js instead of this file, all inside the main React-component.
    It would be better from a practice point-of-view, but would make the main file more
    cluttered. Since this is a low scale project, referring directly to the DOM works fine,
    so we will keep it like this for now.
