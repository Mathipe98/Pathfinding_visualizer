Things that can be implemented:
-Implementation of other algorithms
    *First A*-algorithm
    *Find others after that
-Drag & Drop start/finish nodes
    *Instant visual update on shortest path and visited nodes
-Create buttons so you can choose between algorithms
-Make a pretty menu (update CSS)
-Update animations to make them your own
-Add different kind of walls? Find ideas
-SPLIT THE SCREEN: compare two algorithms to each other
Start with A* so that changing algorithms and visualizing them
becomes more structured.
