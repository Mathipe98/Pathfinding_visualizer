Things that can be implemented:

-Implementation of other algorithms
    *First A*-algorithm (CHECK)
    *Find others after that

-Drag & Drop start/finish nodes
    *Instant visual update on shortest path and visited nodes

-Create buttons so you can choose between algorithms (CHECK)

-Make a pretty menu (update CSS)

-Update animations to make them your own

-Add different kind of walls? Find ideas

-SPLIT THE SCREEN: compare two algorithms to each other
